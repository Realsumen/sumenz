# 4.Univariate Time-Series Analysis

### Motivation -- Why do we perform Time Series Analysis?

Time series data often exhibit dependence across observations, which violates the assumptions of independence required by the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theoremâ€”both of which underpin the asymptotic properties of many estimators. We rely on alternative versions that assume **stationary** and **ergodicity**.
